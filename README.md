# REST SmartThings Home
REST SmartThings Home is a piece of infrastructure that will allow REST access to your SmartThings and have the data sent to an InfluxDB for analysis and visualization with Grafana. It's a tinkerers project for IoT enthusiasts. All the stitching is made with Ansible and is deployable with a single playbook.
